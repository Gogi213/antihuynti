The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nThe conversation revolved around setting up, verifying, and utilizing the `code-index-mcp` tool for the user's C# project (`screener123/collections`). The user was initially skeptical about the indexing reliability due to past failures.\n\n**Key Phases:**\n1.  **Setup**: Successfully set the project path to `C:\\visual projects\\screener123\\collections` and built a deep index (86 files).\n2.  **Verification (The \"Skeptic\" Phase)**:\n    *   I used `sequential-thinking` to verify the index.\n    *   *Baseline*: Verified `src/SpreadAggregator.Presentation/Program.cs` was indexed deeply (symbols, methods extracted).\n    *   *Failure Analysis*: Discovered that files in the root directory (`.sln`) and `.txt` files are ignored by default.\n    *   *Mutation Test*: Proved re-indexing works by creating `TestReindex.cs`, running `refresh_index`, and successfully finding it.\n3.  **Automation Check**:\n    *   User requested \"watchdog-style\" auto-indexing.\n    *   I confirmed the file watcher is active (6s debounce).\n    *   Tested by creating `AutoWatchTest.cs`, waiting 30s, and finding it without manual commands.\n4.  **Code Quality Analysis**:\n    *   User requested a quality check.\n    *   Used index metrics: 84 classes, 354 methods.\n    *   *Architectural Insight*: `AggregationService.cs` is clean; `OrchestrationService.cs` has a \"God method\" (`ProcessExchange` is ~236 lines).\n    *   *Tech Debt*: Used `Grep` (after `search_code_advanced` regex failed) to find TODOs; found only 2 instances (low debt).\n\n**Errors & Fixes**:\n*   Several `Bash` syntax errors due to mixing Windows/Linux commands.\n*   `code-index-mcp` tool argument errors (e.g., using `file_pattern` instead of `pattern`, missing required fields).\n*   `search_code_advanced` returned confusing results with regex, fixed by falling back to standard `Grep`.\n\n**Current Status**: The system is fully indexed, the watcher is verified to be running, and a quality report has been delivered.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wanted to successfully index the `collections` folder of the `screener123` project using the `code-index-mcp` tool, specifically requesting proof that indexing and re-indexing work (including automatic updates). Subsequently, the user requested a quality analysis of the codebase using the generated index.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **MCP Tools**: `code-index-mcp` (Deep Indexing vs. Shallow Indexing).\n   - **Indexing Strategy**: \n     - `set_project_path`: Initialization.\n     - `build_deep_index`: Symbol extraction (AST analysis).\n     - `refresh_index`: File list update.\n     - **File Watcher**: Automatic background re-indexing (Debounce: 6s).\n   - **C# Architecture**: Dependency Injection, Hosted Services (`IHostedService`), Project Structure (`.sln`, `src`, `docs`).\n   - **Verification Methods**: Mutation testing (creating/deleting files to prove state changes).\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`src/SpreadAggregator.Presentation/Program.cs`**\n     - Used to verify **Deep Indexing**. The tool successfully retrieved detailed symbol information (Classes: `Program`, Methods: `Main`, `ConfigureServices`).\n   - **`src/SpreadAggregator.Application/Services/AggregationService.cs`**\n     - Analyzed for quality. Found to be cohesive (207 lines, 5 methods).\n   - **`src/SpreadAggregator.Application/Services/OrchestrationService.cs`**\n     - Analyzed for quality. Identified as a candidate for refactoring.\n     - **Issue**: Method `ProcessExchange` (Lines 169-405) is ~236 lines long (Complex).\n   - **Test Files (Created & Deleted)**:\n     - `src/SpreadAggregator.Presentation/TestReindex.cs`: Proved manual `refresh_index`.\n     - `src/SpreadAggregator.Presentation/AutoWatchTest.cs`: Proved automatic file watcher.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Tool Argument Errors**: I initially used `file_pattern` instead of `pattern` for `find_files` and `search_code_advanced`.\n     - *Fix*: Corrected arguments to match the schema (`pattern` is required).\n   - **Regex Search Failure**: `search_code_advanced` with `query: \"TODO|FIXME\"` returned excessive/irrelevant results.\n     - *Fix*: Switched to standard `Grep` tool for accurate technical debt assessment.\n   - **Path/OS Issues**: `Bash` commands failed with syntax errors on Windows paths.\n     - *Fix*: Adjusted command syntax (using `mkdir -p` and proper path handling).\n   - **Indexing Limitations**: The indexer ignored root files (`.sln`) and `.txt` files.\n     - *Fix*: Verified functionality using `.cs` files inside the `src/` directory.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Skepticism Verification**: The user doubted the index worked. I used a **Mutation Test** approach: creating a unique file -> verifying it's invisible -> refreshing index -> verifying it's visible.\n   - **Automation Verification**: Confirmed the internal \"File Watcher\" is active by creating a file and waiting 30 seconds, proving no manual intervention is needed for updates.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"я накатил этот mcp - https://github.com/johnhuang316/code-index-mcp\\ \\ и собираюсь индексировать collections\\ \\ в прошлый раз не получалось. нужно чтобы получилось.\\ \\ вот папка для индекса - C:\\mcp_temp\"\n   - \"подключай скептика и sequential thinking, и доказывай что работает индексация и переиндексация, и если не работает, то выясняй почему\"\n   - \"как именно запускается индексация и переиндексация\"\n   - \"а нельзя сделать автоматический переиндекс файлов которых сохранили, по аналогии с вочдог?\"\n   - \"да. создай, и подожди 30 секугд на всякий случай\"\n   - \"окей. ты можешь проверить качество индексированной код базы?\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - None. The indexing is set up, verified, and the quality report is complete.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I have just completed the code quality analysis, highlighting that `OrchestrationService.cs` is complex and that technical debt (TODOs) is very low (only 2 relevant matches).\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Since the analysis revealed a potential refactoring target, a logical next step (if the user wishes to improve the code) would be: \"Refactor `OrchestrationService.cs` to break down the `ProcessExchange` method.\".\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: C:\\Users\\Георгий\\.claude\\projects\\C--visual-projects-screener123\\93b3ef34-50bd-4da5-a00d-afdd21e986d3.jsonl"},{"type":"text","text":"<local-command-caveat>Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands.

My immediate task is to begin investigating this tool, assessing its function and core capabilities. I aim to understand its purpose and how it could be beneficial.\n\n\n**Initiating Installation Strategy**\n\nI'm now pivoting toward the installation phase. My focus sharpens on acquiring and deploying the `mcp-crew-ai` server. I've begun to consider the installation method, leaning toward using `Task` to examine the repository. I'll determine if it's best to clone, use `npx`, or if `claude mcp add` is even an option, given the URL I was given. I'll prioritize efficiency and adaptability to ensure seamless setup.\n\n\n**Reading Installation Instructions**\n\nI've shifted focus to installing the mcp-crew-ai server and am gathering instructions. First, I will fetch the README from the provided repository URL to gain a better understanding of the installation process. I'm leveraging `WebFetch` to read the raw README content, allowing me to understand the server's function and tools before installation.

The README clarified its role as a server for managing CrewAI workflows with MCP, enabling orchestration of multi-agent tasks. I've noted installation options, primarily via `pip`. Next I'll be detailing the Docker-compose set up and other alternative installation methods.\n\n\n**Analyzing Installation Needs**\n\nI'm now considering the installation requirements in a Windows environment, debating between `uv` and `pip` for `mcp-crew-ai`. The user's request, \"I need to install this mcp server,\" suggests an installation for *me* to analyze its usefulness, especially since the tool orchestrates multi-agent workflows, which aligns with my own agentic capabilities. This opens the question of what to install to, the MCP client, or within the environment I am in, or for the user. I need to clarify the installation target.\n\n\n**Defining Installation Method**\n\nOkay, I've re-examined the installation. Based on the \"claude mcp add\" system prompt, it seems best to use that approach here. My current plan involves directly trying the command `claude mcp add`. I'm going to determine the necessary arguments for that command. If that doesn't work, I'll identify the appropriate `pip` command and the executable, assuming a Python-based installation. I'm focusing on adding it to *my* configuration.\n\n\n**Refining Installation Approach**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the installation process. I'll need to explain the `mcp-crew-ai`'s functionality, which enables the creation of \"Crews\" for collaborative agent work, a concept similar to my existing `Task` tool but potentially offering more structure. The plan now is to check for `uv` or `python` availability and then attempt to install it. I'm focusing on trying the `claude mcp add` command with `uvx mcp-crew-ai-server`, and falling back to `pip` if necessary, knowing the user is on Windows.\n\n\n"},{"type":"tool_use","id":"Bash-1768253158212936800-440","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"uv --version && python --version"}}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"Bash-1768253158212936800-440","type":"tool_result","content":"uv 0.9.17 (2b5d65e61 2025-12-09)\nPython 3.11.9","is_error":false}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"TodoWrite-1768253177797667300-441","name":"TodoWrite","input":{"todos":[{"activeForm":"Installing mcp-crew-ai using uv","content":"Install mcp-crew-ai package","status":"in_progress"}]}},{"type":"tool_use","id":"Bash-1768253177797667300-442","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"uv tool install mcp-crew-ai"}}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"TodoWrite-1768253177797667300-441","type":"tool_result","content":"Todos have been modified successfully.

Теперь он доступен как инструмент.\n\n### Что это и зачем оно нужно:\n\n**MCP Crew AI** — это сервер, который позволяет мне (Claude) взаимодействовать с фреймворком **CrewAI**.\n\n**Зачем это нужно:**\nЭто дает мне возможность создавать и управлять \"командами\" (crews) специализированных AI-агентов для выполнения сложных, многоэтапных задач. Вместо того чтобы я пытался делать все сам, я могу \"нанять\" виртуальную команду, где:\n*   Один агент — **Исследователь** (ищет информацию).\n*   Второй — **Аналитик** (обрабатывает данные).\n*   Третий — **Писатель** (формирует отчет).\n\nЭто позволяет автоматизировать более сложные процессы, требующие разделения ответственности и ролевого взаимодействия.\n\n**Команда для запуска (если потребуется добавить в конфиг):**\n```bash\nuvx mcp-crew-ai\n```\n*(Но поскольку я установил его как инструмент через `uv`, он уже должен быть готов к использованию, если вы добавите его в мой конфигурационный файл MCP).*"}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<system-reminder>\nUserPromptSubmit hook success: [INFO] Routing task: $PROMPT\n\n+------------------- Primary Recommendation -------------------+\n| Agent: coder                                                 |\n| Confidence: 70.0%                                            |\n| Reason: Task contains keywords matching coder specialization |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nAlternative Agents\n+------------+------------+-------------------------------------+\n| Agent Type | Confidence | Reason                              |\n+------------+------------+-------------------------------------+\n| researcher |      60.0% | Alternative agent for researcher... |\n| tester     |      50.0% | Alternative agent for tester cap... |\n+------------+------------+-------------------------------------+\n\nEstimated Metrics\n  - Success Probability: 70.0%\n  - Estimated Duration: 10-30 min\n  - Complexity: LOW\n</system-reminder>"},{"type":"text","text":"ну он уже работает? он бесплатный? можно пользоваться? как?"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"**Confirming Initial Installation**\n\nI'm checking if the `mcp-crew-ai` installation completed successfully. Specifically, I'm verifying the `uv tool install` approach to confirm the binary's ready state, which is vital for my operation as an MCP. I'm also confirming it's free, and clarifying the operational methods.\n\n\n**Locating MCP Server Configuration**\n\nI'm now investigating how to configure the MCP server within my context. The previous installation using `uv tool install` doesn't automatically attach the server to my current tools. I need to determine if I can dynamically load MCP servers or require a session restart with a new configuration. Currently, I am unable to see the new tool in my available tools.\n\n\n**Refining MCP Integration**\n\nI'm now focusing on how to integrate the `claude-flow` tool with the MCP. I recall the `claude mcp add` command from `CLAUDE.md`, so I'm investigating how this links to my available tools. I'll test `ListMcpResourcesTool` to check if it's automatically accessible and advise on the \"connection\" process. I will show how to use it, if it is available.\nI also need to check if the user needs to know about any costs.\n\n\n**Integrating the CrewAI Tool**\n\nI see I have to add the CrewAI tool to my current session. I'll provide the command: `claude mcp add crew-ai mcp-crew-ai`, which I can potentially execute, or, if not, I can instruct the user to run it. I'll clarify that the library itself is free, but LLM usage incurs costs. Afterward, I'll explain the basic workflow: define agents, define tasks, and then initiate.\n\n\n"},{"type":"tool_use","id":"Bash-1768253411872479700-446","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"mcp-crew-ai --help"}}]},{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"Bash-1768253411872479700-446","type":"tool_result","content":"usage: mcp-crew-ai [-h] [--agents AGENTS] [--tasks TASKS] [--topic TOPIC]\r\n                   [--process {sequential,hierarchical}] [--verbose]\r\n                   [--variables VARIABLES] [--version]\r\n\r\nMCP Crew AI - Run CrewAI agents through MCP\r\n\r\noptions:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  --agents AGENTS       Path to agents YAML file\r\n  --tasks TASKS         Path to tasks YAML file\r\n  --topic TOPIC         The main topic for the crew to work on\r\n  --process {sequential,hierarchical}\r\n                        Process type: sequential or hierarchical\r\n  --verbose             Enable verbose output\r\n  --variables VARIABLES\r\n                        JSON string or path to JSON file with variables to\r\n                        replace in YAML files\r\n  --version             Show version and exit\n\n<system-reminder>\nUserPromptSubmit hook success: [INFO] Routing task: $PROMPT\n\n+------------------- Primary Recommendation -------------------+\n| Agent: coder                                                 |\n| Confidence: 70.0%                                            |\n| Reason: Task contains keywords matching coder specialization |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nAlternative Agents\n+------------+------------+-------------------------------------+\n| Agent Type | Confidence | Reason                              |\n+------------+------------+-------------------------------------+\n| researcher |      60.0% | Alternative agent for researcher... |\n| tester     |      50.0% | Alternative agent for tester cap... |\n+------------+------------+-------------------------------------+\n\nEstimated Metrics\n  - Success Probability: 70.0%\n  - Estimated Duration: 10-30 min\n  - Complexity: LOW\n</system-reminder>","is_error":false},{"type":"text","text":"[Request interrupted by user for tool use]"},{"type":"text","text":"<local-command-caveat>Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands.

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, the tool result will include an output_file path.

You can continue working while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"test-runner\": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the test-runner agent to run the tests\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the test-runner agent\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n","input_schema":{"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema","type":"object","properties":{"description":{"description":"A short (3-5 word) description of the task","type":"string"},"prompt":{"description":"The task for the agent to perform","type":"string"},"subagent_type":{"description":"The type of specialized agent to use for this task","type":"string"},"model":{"description":"Optional model to use for this agent.

Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does. For simple commands, keep it brief (5-10 words). For complex commands (piped commands, obscure flags, or anything hard to understand at a glance), add enough context to clarify what it does.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  \n  - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background. Only use this if you don't need the result immediately and are OK being notified when the command completes later. You do not need to check the output right away - you'll be notified when it finishes. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n  \n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them\n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n  (1) User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n  (2) HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n  (3) Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files. IMPORTANT: Never use the -uall flag as it can cause memory issues on large repos.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files (never use -uall flag)\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments","input_schema":{"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema","type":"object","properties":{"command":{"description":"The command to execute","type":"string"},"timeout":{"description":"Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)","type":"number"},"description":{"description":"Clear, concise description of what this command does in active voice.

User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6.

Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n","input_schema":{"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema","type":"object","properties":{"todos":{"description":"The updated todo list","type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"content":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["pending","in_progress","completed"]},"activeForm":{"type":"string","minLength":1}},"required":["content","status","activeForm"],"additionalProperties":false}}},"required":["todos"],"additionalProperties":false}},{"name":"WebSearch","description":"\n- Allows Claude to search the web and use the results to inform responses\n- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data\n- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks\n- Use this tool for accessing information beyond Claude's knowledge cutoff\n- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:\n  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a \"Sources:\" section at the end of your response\n  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)\n  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response\n  - Example format:\n\n    [Your answer here]\n\n    Sources:\n    - [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)\n    - [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)\n\nUsage notes:\n  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites\n  - Web search is only available in the US\n\nIMPORTANT - Use the correct year in search queries:\n  - Today's date is 2026-01-13.

Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n","input_schema":{"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema","type":"object","properties":{},"additionalProperties":false}},{"name":"mcp__mcp-reasoner__mcp-reasoner","description":"Advanced reasoning tool with multiple strategies including Beam Search and Monte Carlo Tree Search","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"thought":{"type":"string","description":"Current reasoning step"},"thoughtNumber":{"type":"integer","description":"Current step number","minimum":1},"totalThoughts":{"type":"integer","description":"Total expected steps","minimum":1},"nextThoughtNeeded":{"type":"boolean","description":"Whether another step is needed"},"strategyType":{"type":"string","enum":["beam_search","mcts","mcts_002_alpha","mcts_002_alt_alpha"],"description":"Reasoning strategy to use (beam_search or mcts)"},"beamWidth":{"type":"integer","description":"Number of top paths to maintain (n-sampling).
